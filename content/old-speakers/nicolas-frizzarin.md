    title: "The next generation of Angular Applications"
    abstract: "Angular 14 was released in June 2022, and this version announce that modules will become optional.
<br><br>
Oh wouuahhh, until now modules were th basics concepts of an Angular application. The entire architecture of our applications revolved under this concepts. To summary, modules were a central part of Angular application.
<br>
Since Angular 14, it's the component that occupy this role. These specifics components are called \"Standalone Components\"
<br>
<br>
However this release brings many other features, all very interesting such as:<br>
<br>
- composition API by injection<br>
- types forms and new APIs to manage dynamic form<br>
- a new way to manage the title of our single page application<br>
- function guards<br>
<br>
How will these new features change the way we architect our applications. How to integrate them into our existings applications ? Will the module become deprecated ?
<br><br>
This talk answer to these questions by explaning all the concepts with exemples."
