    title: "Compose-View Interop in Practice"
    abstract: "If you’re working on an already established, large code base, there’s a good chance that your screens still use Views to some extent. However, these screens should still be maintained to keep UI consistency across your app. In this talk, we’ll look at how we can support the maintenance of such screens and custom UI components with Jetpack Compose’s interoperability features while discussing the ups and downs of having hybrid UIs in our apps."
