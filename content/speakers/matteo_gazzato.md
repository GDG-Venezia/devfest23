    title: "Stop looking for MVI on the internet"
    abstract: "In the last 2 years, most of developers are appreciating Jetpack Compose and all its benefits. But as declarative framework, MVVM approach is not totally fitting.
    <br><br>
    Have you ever heard of Model-View-Intent (MVI)? Have you noticed how many implementations of this pattern are there on the internet? If you haven't or if you are confused about the topic, this is the right speech for you.
    <br><br>
    A lot of devs joined the adventure in the MVI world, bringing some good ideas, but always missed some crucial theoretical principles.
    <br><br>
    We took the \"good ideas\" and built, piece by piece, a grown implementation ready for production.
    <br><br>
    What we want to show you is:
    <br>
    - what MVI is and the principles behind it;<br>
    - why you should choose MVI;<br>
    - MVI layers and components, showing you some actual code;<br>
    - our experience with MVI in a production app.
    <br><br>
    By the end of this talk you should have a good knowledge of the principles of MVI and how to implement it in your apps."
