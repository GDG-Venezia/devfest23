    title: "Open source, from zero to my hero: Valentino Rossi"
    abstract: "Since I was little I would have liked to meet Valentino Rossi, but there was never the chance to meet him.<br><br>
    Then I started my working career and priorities changed, in fact I am a developer and in my free time I have been contributing to open source for years.<br><br>
    In this session I would like to share my experience with you and reveal how I finally met my idol thanks to open source."
