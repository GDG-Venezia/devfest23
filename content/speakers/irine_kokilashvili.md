    title: "Sustainability for workloads in Google Cloud"
    abstract: "Sustainability in the cloud is the continuous dedication to primarily decrease energy usage and optimize efficiency across all aspects of workloads.
    <br><br>
    Assuming the responsibility for your emissions embodies ethical values, cost-efficiency, regulatory compliance, and environmental impact awareness.
    It also reflects your commitment to being the part of the solution rather than contributing to the problem.
    <br><br>
    In this talk you will learn about design principles, best-practices, potential trade-offs, and improvement plans you can use to meet sustainability targets for your Google Cloud workloads."
