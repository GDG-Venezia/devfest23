bio: "Hello, I am Anıl.
I have been working at Trendyol for about 4.5 years. Currently, in the team we call the \"Platform Team\", we are working on topics like build time optimization, launch time optimization, developer experience, modular structure, and R&D. Instead of focusing on features, we research and implement how the app can reach a better level.
<br><br>
So far at Trendyol, I have been part of the Trendyol app, the Meal App, and the DevOps team. We set up CI&CD servers and launched a system where 40 machines can run in parallel.
<br><br>
Apart from these, I try to write on Medium to share what I've learned, share our experiences on Twitter, and give presentations whenever possible. I am a moderator at NSIstanbul, the largest iOS community in Turkey. Nowadays, I am focusing on growing my own channel and aiming to create a new community for the iOS side."
