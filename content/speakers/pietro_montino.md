    title: "Automatic unstructured PDF ingestion on GCP"
    abstract: "The scope of this session is to show how it is possible to create a Question Answering agent on GCP starting from complex documents, like technical handbooks. This will be done by using the following passages:
    <br><br>
    1. Document Segmentation<br>
    Semantic structures (like title, sections, tables...) will be inferred with State-of-the-Art models.
    <br><br>
    2. Optical Character Recognition (OCR)<br>
    Google OCR will be applied to the previously-determined structures in order to determine their content.
    <br><br>
    3. Vectorization<br>
    The text will be saved in a vector store in order to allow a fast information retrieval.
    <br><br>
    4. Large Language Model (LLM) Connection<br>
    The vector store will be connected to an LLM that will be used to provide the user with suitable answers for his/her questions.
    <br><br>
    This project will showcase the capabilities of State-of-the-Art models and technologies in the field of Generative AI."
