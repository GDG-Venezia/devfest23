bio: Niels is a self-professed browser geek and a Google Developer Expert and Mozilla TechSpeaker. He has been hooked on browsers ever since somebody showed him the original Nexus browser on a NeXT Cube back in the dark ages of the internet. Niels is the creator of HTML5test.com and runs one of the largest Open Device Labs in the world. He loves procrastinating, collecting weird devices with even stranger browsers, drawing pixel art monsters, procrastinating, researching obscure browsers and tinkering with hardware.

    title: "Making money with Project Fugu"
    abstract: "Join us for an in-depth talk on creating a point-of-sale system entirely using web technologies.
    <br><br>
    In this session, we will explore the power of hardware APIs, such as WebHID, WebUSB and WebSerial, and connect the browser to essential components such as a cash drawer, customer display, receipt printer and barcode scanner. We'll also touch on other new Project Fugu APIs like Idle Detection, Multi-screen Window Placement and Shape Detection. And finally, we will show how this works in practice with a live demonstration of all the components.
    <br><br>
    Now, a point-of-sale system might not sound very exciting, but we're doing a deep dive into how to connect hardware devices to web apps, and show you how you would go about doing this for your own devices."
