bio: "It's never easy to describe oneself, especially when one is interested in so many different topics and fields and I guess that says something about who I am afterall. I find it fun and entertaining to teach difficult subjects through exotic methods and stories and people seem to also have fun while I do so.
<br><br>
I believe in the union between science and human values (read fun) and I often work and participate in non-profit organization and projects which aim to bring culture and scientific knowledge."

    title: "Sustainable me. A tale of good design."
    abstract: "Everyone is talking about the importance of renewable energy, climate agreements, and the fight against climate change but have you ever stopped to think about the impact of all the apps and online tools have on the environment? It is time to recognise that not every issue has the size of an elephant and we can actually change the world with so fewer steps than we imagine.
    <br><br>
    Join me on a journey to discover how we can use good design and best practices to create a more sustainable internet and make a difference in the fight against global warming.
    <br><br>
    Let's green this, one div at a time!"
