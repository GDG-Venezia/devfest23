    title: "Flutter. New Approach to Web Development."
    abstract: "In the modern world, it is very rare for businesses to only require a website or only a mobile application. Typically, it is necessary to create both a website and a mobile application together. In such a situation, there is always a choice of which technologies to use. There are generally three options: developing separate web and native mobile applications, with the mobile development team handling the native app; building a web application for mobile devices, such as a PWA (Progressive Web App); or using a cross-platform solution that allows reusing the code between platforms.
<br><br>
Recently, an interesting alternative to traditional approaches emergedâ€”a new framework by Google called Flutter. With Flutter, you can develop mobile, desktop, and web applications. However, the approach used in Flutter for Web differs significantly from traditional web application development. So, can we consider Flutter applications for the web as web applications?"
